# 👋 Dominika Adrianna Ochecka

Welcome to my **Data Technician Bootcamp portfolio**!  

This repository documents my **first journey through a hands-on IT Bootcamp**, where I explored new tools, techniques, and real-world data projects for the very first time. Here you'll find my **notes, exercises, and code examples** from each week, showcasing the development of my analytical and programming skills.  



During the course, I gained hands-on experience in several key areas:

- 📊 **Excel** – data analysis, Pivot Tables, SUM, AVERAGE, SWITCH functions, and data visualization  
- 📈 **Tableau & Power BI** – building dashboards, interactive reports, and maps  
- 🗄️ **SQL** – writing queries, joining tables, and exploring real-world databases  
- ☁️ **Cloud & Azure** – understanding IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, performing data analysis in Azure, and working on practical business scenarios  
- 🐍 **Python & Pandas**

## 🗓️ Day 1 – Cloud Computing Basics

### ☁️ Key Concepts

**Real-world uses of cloud computing:**

- 🗄️ Store files online (Google Drive, iCloud)  
- 🌐 Use apps via a browser (Gmail, Microsoft 365)  
- 💻 Run programs without buying powerful computers  
- 📍 Work from anywhere with internet access  

**Business benefits:**

- 💰 Save money on hardware & maintenance  
- 🔄 Work flexibly, access data anywhere  
- 📈 Scale easily (storage & computing)  
- 🛡️ Security & backups handled by provider  

**Alternative:** On-premises computing – hardware & servers managed in-house.

### ☁️ Cloud Providers & Services

| Provider | Known For | Example Services |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| AWS | Largest, flexible, powerful | Hosting websites, storing data, AI tools |
| Microsoft Azure | Works well with MS products | Virtual machines, Office 365, data storage |
| GCP | Data analysis & ML | BigQuery, cloud storage, AI tools |
| IBM Cloud | Business & AI focus | Data & AI solutions, hybrid cloud |
| Oracle Cloud | Strong for databases | Cloud databases, analytics |
